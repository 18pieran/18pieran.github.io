<p> Olivia and I are going to work together and are going to either use the lazer cutter to cut out something or going to our own make music.</p>

<p> We will have to learn how to program the lazer cutter or learn how to use a music program.</p>

<p> We will have to start desining our the thing we wil cut out or will have to desin our music. Might have to download garage band or another music program that we can use. <p/>
