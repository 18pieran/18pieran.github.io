# Your WCS Blog

In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog like the one below giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Make a copy of this repo for yourself

Fork this repo, then go to settings. In the name of the repo, change `YOURUSERNAME` to your actual github username. It's important that you keep the `.github.io` after your username. My github username is `andytilia` so my repo name would be `andytilia.github.io`.

Your Jekyll blog will soon be viewable immediately at <https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io> .

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the ` _config.yml` file.

Sometimes it take github up to 10 minutes to actually show any changes or new blog posts.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Go to the `/_posts/` folder. Then put `2014-3-3-Hello-World.html` in edit mode.

Notice this is not a full HTML page. You are only writing what would normally go inside the `<body>` tags of a full HTML page. 

Make some changes to this page (but see the part between the `---` and the `---` at the top of the page? that needs to stay there. you can change the title if you want.)


### Step 4) Creating new blog posts
Just go to the `/_posts/` folder, and click `Create new file`.

Name the file in this format: `year-month-day-title.html`

The beginning of the file contents need to be the following, but of course you should write better titles than me.
```
---
layout: post
title: My second post!
---

```
Below that type what you would normally put inside the `<body>` tags of an html page.
